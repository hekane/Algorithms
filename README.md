# Algorithms
 This is for educational purposes. The project consist of my implementations of various algorithms. The idea was to learn and experiment their functionality  and undertand their time complexity and structure. The project is coded in Python. I may add multithreaded Java versions later.

## Libraries
- **random**, for randomizing lists etc.
- **colorama**, for visualizing the output
- **time**, for timing algortihm execute times

## Currently implemented algoritms
### Sorting algorithms (sorting.py)
- bubble sort
- flagged bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- merge sort
